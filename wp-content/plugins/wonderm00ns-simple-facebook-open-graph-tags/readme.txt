Inserts Facebook Open Graph, Google+/Schema.org, Twitter and SEO Meta Tags into your WordPress Website for more efficient sharing results.

== Description ==

This plugin inserts Facebook Open Graph Tags into your WordPress Blog/Website for more effective and efficient Facebook sharing results.

It also allows you to add the Twitter Card tags for more effective and efficient Twitter sharing results.

It also allows you to add the Meta Description tag and Schema.org Name, Description and Image tags for more effective and efficient Google+ sharing results.

You can also choose to insert the "enclosure" and "media:content" tags to the RSS feeds, so that apps like RSS Graffiti and twitterfeed post the image to Facebook correctly.

It allows the user to choose which tags are, or not, included and also the default image if the post/page doesn't have one.

BETA: It's also possible to add a overlay logo to the image. The plugin will resize and crop the original image to 1200x630 and then overlay the chosen 1200x630 PNG file over it. Can be usefull to add your brand to the image that shows up on Facebook shared links.

Our settings page is discreetly kept under "Options", as it should, instead of taking up premium space on the main menu bar with colored, non WordPress styled, icons.

== Installation ==

1. Use the included automatic install feature on your WordPress admin panel and search for “Open Graph for Facebook, Google+ and Twitter Card Tags”.
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
3. Go to `Options`, `Open Graph for Facebook, Google+ and Twitter Card Tags` to set it up

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Facebook is not showing up the correct image when I share a post. What can I do? =

1. Are you using a big enough image? The minimum image size is 200x200 pixels but we recommend 1200x630.
2. Are you sure you only have one `og:image` tag on the source code? Make sure you're not using more than one plugin to set OG tags?
3. Go to the [Facebook Sharing Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/), insert your URL, click `Debug`. Then click on `Scrape Again` to make sure Facebook gets the current version of your HTML code and not a cached version. If the image that shows up on the preview (bottom of the page) is the correct one, then the tags are well set and it "should" be the one that Facebook uses when sharing the post. If it still does not use the correct image when sharing, despite the debugger shows it correctly, there's nothing more we can do about that. That's just Facebook being Facebook.

= What is the "Manually update Facebook cache" button on the "Post updated" notice? =

It's a shortcut to the Facebook Sharing Debugger, where you should click on `Scrape Again` to make sure Facebook gets the current version of your post or page.

= When I save/edit my post I get the "Facebook Open Graph Tags cache NOT updated/purged" error. Should I worry? =

Each time you edit a post, if the option "Try to update Facebook Open Graph Tags cache when saving the post" is activated, we'll try to notify Facebook of the changes so it clears up it's cache and read the new Open Graph tags of this specific URL.
If this is a new post and it's the first time you're saving it, the error is "normal" and you should ignore it (we're looking at a workaround to not show you this error).
If this is not a new post and it's not the first time you're saving it, and if this happens always, then maybe your server does not support calling remote URLs with PHP and you should disable the "Try to update Facebook Open Graph Tags cache when saving the post" option. In that scenario we recommend you to use the [Facebook Sharing Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/) to `Scrape Again` each time you update your post.
Sometimes the plugin just can't update the Facebook cache itself and you may need to do it manually on the link provided above.

= Can I authenticate the call to Facebook, with my own app, when trying to update the cache, so I get rid of the "An access token is required to request this resource" error? =

Yes, you can. Create a Facebook App and fill in the details on the "Facebook Open Graph Tags cache" panel of the plugin settings page.
Do NOT ask us support on this. There is [a blog post on our website](https://www.webdados.pt/2017/12/successfully-update-facebook-cache-using-our-facebook-open-graph-plugin/) explaining everything you need to do.

= Facebook says "The following required properties are missing: fb:app_id". Should I worry? =

No. Move along.

= How can I share my posts or products as Rich Pins on Pinterest? =

Pinterest can read Open Graph tags, so no extra tags are needed to share your articles or WooCommerce products as Rich Pins.

You need however to apply in order to whitelist your domain on Pinterest. Head to [this page](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/rich-pins/overview/) and follow the instructions starting with "Set up". When in the validator, enter your URL, hit "Validate" and then choose "HTML tags" and hit "Apply now". It's then up to Pinterest to accept your application or not.

= Can this plugin get content from "random plugin"? =

If there's a popular plugin you think we could get content from to use on the meta tags, use the support forum to tell us that.
If you are a plugin or theme author you can always use our filters `fb_og_title`, `fb_og_desc`, `fb_og_url`, `fb_og_type`, `fb_type_schema`, `fb_og_image`, `fb_og_image_additional`, `fb_og_image_overlay`, `fb_og_locale`, `fb_og_app_id`, `fb_og_thumb_fill_color`, `fb_og_output` and `fb_og_enabled` to customize the Open Graph (and other) meta tags output.

= What is the array structure for the `fb_og_image_additional` filter?

Chouck out this [code snippet](https://gist.github.com/webdados/ef5d5db01f01bee6041c2b2e0950d73a).

= I'm getting a white screen of death / truncated HTML =

Go to the plugin settings and check the `Do not get image size` option.
This happens on some edge cases we haven't yet been able to identify.
Update: Probably fixed for some users on 2.1.4.5 and completely on 2.2 (pending confirmation)

= Yoast SEO shows up a big nasty warning if both plugins are active. Is the world in danger if I keep both plugins active? =

No it isn't.
You can (and, in our opinion, you should) use both plugins. If you want to use Yoast SEO for your SEO needs and our plugin for social media meta tags you just have to go to "SEO > Social" and disable settings for Facebook, Twitter and Google+.
If you don't find that option, because they've now made it harder to reach, you have to go to "SEO > Dashboard > Features > Advanced settings pages > choose Enabled and Save changes". Then you can reach "SEO > Social".
Then set up our plugin as you wish and you're ready to go.
We like to work with everybody, so (if you want to) our plugin can even integrate with Yoast SEO and use it's title, description and canonical URL on the Facebook, Google+ and Twitter tags.

= There's a similar plugin on the repository, by Heateor. Is this the same? =

It's similar, yes. They've forked our plugin and gave no credits whatsoever for our original work.

= Do you provide email support? =

We DO NOT provide email support for this plugin. If you send us an email asking for support you'll be invited to:
1. Post the question on the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wonderm00ns-simple-facebook-open-graph-tags)
2. Or we can give you a quote on premium email/phone support if you prefer to
