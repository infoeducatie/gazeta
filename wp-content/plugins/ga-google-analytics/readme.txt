== Installation ==

**Installation**

1. Upload the plugin to your blog and activate
2. Visit the settings to configure your options

After configuring your settings, you can verify that GA code is included by viewing the source code of your web pages.

__Note:__ this plugin adds the required GA code to your web pages. In order for the code to do anything, it must correspond to an active, properly configured Google Analytics account. Learn more at the [Google Analytics Help Center](https://support.google.com/analytics/?hl=en#topic=3544906).

[More info on installing WP plugins](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins)


**Usage**

After entering your GA Property ID, enable the setting "Enable Google Analytics". This enables the legacy tracking method, which is deprecated and soon to be replaced by the new tracking method, "Universal Analytics". To go ahead and start using Universal Analytics right now, also enable the next setting, "Enable Universal Analytics". 

Then from there you can enable advanced tracking functionality such as "Display Advertising" and "Link Attribution", depending on your own statistical strategy. If ever in doubt, consult the official [Google Analytics site](https://developers.google.com/analytics/) and [Help Center](https://support.google.com/analytics/?hl=en#topic=3544906).

To upgrade GA Google Analytics, remove the old version and replace with the new version. Or just click "Update" from the Plugins screen and let WordPress do it for you automatically.

__Note:__ uninstalling the plugin from the WP Plugins screen results in the removal of all settings from the WP database.
