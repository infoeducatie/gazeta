== Changelog ==
= [4.21.1] 16.12.2015 =
* Fix: 'Update' button did not work at User's Capabilities page due to confirmation dialog call error.


= [4.21] 11.12.2015 =
* It's possible to switch off the update role confirmation (Settings - User Role Editor - General tab).
* Standard JavaScript confirm box before role update was replaced with custom one to exclude 'Prevent this page from creating additional dialogs' option in the Google Chrome browser.
* Fix: Removed hard coded folder name (user-role-editor) from the used paths.


= [4.20.1] 15.11.2015 =
* Fix: "Primary default role" drop-down menu was not shown at "Settings - User Role Editor - Default Roles" tab for WordPress single site installation.

= [4.20] 15.11.2015 =
* "Additional options" section was added to the user role editor page. Currently it contains the only "Hide admin bar". The list of options may be customized/extended by developers via "ure_role_additonal_options" filter.
* "Default Role" button is hidden to not duplicate functionality. Use "Settings - User Role Editor - Default Roles" tab instead. This button is available only for the single sites of WP multisite now.
* Code restructure, optimization: administrator protection parts extracted to the separate class.

= [4.19.3] 14.10.2015 =
* Fix: minor CSS change.
* Automatically add all available custom post types capabilities to the administrator role under the single site environment. Custom posts types selection query updated to include all custom post types except 'built-in' when adding custom capabilities for them
* Special flag was set to indicate that single site administrator gets raised (superadmin) permissions temporary especially for the 'user-new.php' page, but current user is not the superadmin really. 
  (This temporary permissions raising is done to allow single site administrator to add new users under multisite if related option is active.)

= [4.19.2] 01.10.2015 =
* Fix: multiple default roles assignment did not work under the multisite environment, when user was created from front-end by WooCommerce, etc.
* Update: the translation text domain was changed to the plugin slug (user-role-editor) for the compatibility with translations.wordpress.org
* Update: CSS enhanced to exclude column wrapping for the capabilities with the long names.

= [4.19.1] 20.08.2015 =
* Default role value has not been refreshed automatically after change at the "Default Role" dialog - fixed.
* More detailed notice messages are shown after default role change - to reflect a possible error or problem.
* Other default roles (in addition to the primary role) has been assigned to a new registered user for requests from the admin back-end only. Now this feature works for the requests from the front-end user registration forms too.

= 4.19 =
* 28.07.2015
* It is possible to assign to the user multiple roles directly through a user profile edit page. 
* Custom SQL-query (checked if the role is in use and slow on the huge data) was excluded and replaced with WordPress built-in function call. [Thanks to Aaron](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/poorly-scaling-queries).
* Bulk role assignment to the users without role was rewritten for cases with a huge quant of users. It processes just 50 users without role for the one request to return the answer from the server in the short time. The related code was extracted to the separate class.
* Code to fix JavaScript and CSS compatibility issues introduced by other plugins and themes, which load its stuff globally, was extracted into the separate class.
* Custom filters were added: 'ure_full_capabilites' - takes 1 input parameter, array with a full list of user capabilities visible at URE, 'ure_built_in_wp_caps' - takes 1 input parameter, array with a list of WordPress core user capabilities. These filters may be useful if you give access to the URE for some not administrator user, and wish to change the list of capabilities which are available to him at URE.
* Dutch translation was updated. Thanks to Gerhard Hoogterp.

= 4.18.4 =
* 30.04.2015
* Calls to the function add_query_arg() is properly escaped with esc_url_raw() to exclude potential XSS vulnerabilities. Nothing critical: both calls of add_query_arg() are placed at the unused sections of the code.
* Italian translation was updated. Thanks to Leo.

= 4.18.3 =
* 24.02.2015
* Fixed PHP fatal error for roles reset operation.
* Fixed current user capability checking before URE Options page open.
* 3 missed phrases were added to the translations files. Thanks to [Morteza](https://wordpress.org/support/profile/mo0orteza)
* Hebrew translation updated. Thanks to [atar4u](http://atar4u.com)
* Persian translation updated. Thanks to [Morteza](https://wordpress.org/support/profile/mo0orteza)

= 4.18.2 =
* 06.02.2015
* New option "Edit user capabilities" was added. If it is unchecked - capabilities section of selected user will be shown in the readonly mode. Administrator (except superadmin for multisite) can not assign capabilities to the user directly. He should make it using roles only.
* More universal checking applied to the custom post type capabilities creation to exclude not existing property notices.
* Multisite: URE's options page is prohibited by 'manage_network_users' capability instead of 'ure_manage_options' in case single site administrators does not have permission to use URE.
* URE protects administrator user from editing by other users by default. If you wish to turn off such protection, you may add filter 'ure_supress_administrators_protection' and return 'true' from it.
* Plugin installation to the WordPress multisite with large (thousands) subsites had a problem with script execution time. Fixed. URE does not try to update all subsites at once now. It does it for every subsite separately, only when you visit that subsite.
* Fixed JavaScript bug with 'Reset Roles' for FireFox v.34.
