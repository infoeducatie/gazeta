Automatic git version control and deployment for your plugins and themes integrated into wp-admin.


== Description ==

Gitium enables continuous deployment for WordPress, integrating with tools such as Github, Bitbucket or Travis-CI. Theme or plugin updates, installs and removals are all automatically versioned. Ninja code edits from the WordPress editor are also tracked by the version control system.

Gitium is designed with sane development environments in mind, allowing staging and production to follow different branches of the same repository. You can also deploy code by simply using `git push`.

Gitium requires `git` command line tool with a minimum version of 1.7 installed on the server and the `proc_open` PHP function enabled.

You can find more documentation on [Presslabs](https://www.presslabs.com/help/gitium/general).

4. Setup step 4: Choose following branch
5. Commit local changes


== Installation ==

= Manual Installation =
1. Upload `gitium.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory;
2. Extract the `gitium.zip` archive into the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory;
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

Alternatively, go into your WordPress dashboard and click on Plugins -> Add Plugin and search for `Gitium`. Then, click on Install and, after that, on Activate Now.


= Usage =

Activate the plugin and follow the on-screen instructions under the `Gitium` menu.

_IMPORTANT_: Gitium does its best not to version your WordPress core, neither your `/wp-content/uploads` folder.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Could not connect to remote repository? =

If you encounter this kind of error you can try to fix it by setting the proper username of the .git directory.

Example: chown -R www-data:www-data .git

= Is this plugin considered stable? =

Yes, we consider the plugin stable after extensive usage in production environments at Presslabs, with hundreds of users and powering sites with hundreds of millions of pageviews per month.

= What will happen in case of conflicts? =

The behavior in case of conflicts is to overwrite the changes on the `origin` repository with the local changes (ie. local modifications take precedence over remote ones).

= How to deploy automatically after a push? =

You can ping the webhook url after a push to automatically deploy the new code. The webhook url can be found under `Gitium` menu, `Settings` section. This url also plays well with Github or Bitbucket webhooks.

= Does it work on multi site setups? =

Yes, Gitium is working on multi site setups.

= How does gitium handle submodules? =

Submodules are currently not supported.
