* The main css stylesheet of the Hueman theme is located in /assets/front/css/main.css.

* The main reason why the main stylesheet of the Hueman theme has been moved to another place is minification.
* Minification is a technique to compress a css file and therefore improve speed (page load time) of your website.

* This style.css file provides details about the Theme (in the form of comments above) that is read by WordPress, and therefore cannot be minified.

* Note : You can load the not minified stylesheet if you uncheck the option in the customizer > Advanced Options > performances

* To make important CSS customizations, you'll want to use a child theme and add your css rules in the style.css file of this child theme.
